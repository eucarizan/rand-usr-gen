## learning
create a web page that can fetch random user data from api for testing purposes and display it on a web page. also, work with promises and handle different data structures.

## about
do you know how developers test their apps with random user data? well, they can use public apis to generate that data, like how they use lorem ipsum for dummy text. creating a web page to display those random user profiles using html and js is a great way to practice working with data and public apis. pretty neat, huh? take this project to find out how you can do it.
